# intro-to-testing

The following instructions **ARE NOT** to install/use this repo; they are to recreate for scratch this project.

### My personal script to set up any repo

```sh
npm init -y
git init
touch .gitignore
echo -e "# dependencies\nnode_modules/\n" >> .gitignore
echo -e "# coverage\ncoverage/\n" >> .gitignore
```
